  The Owl Line Online Bookstore established in 2017,is the online version of the Kennesaw State on-campus bookstore. <br/>
  Our main purpose is to supply students who do not have an easy way to buy/rent books, with a convient way to not only<br/>
  purchase/rent the recommended or required textbooks per class, but to also have those books shipped to them<br/>
  anywhere within the United States.
